# Gutenag

This simple plugin hides the "try Gutenberg" nag in the WordPress dashboard. This feature was introduced in [WordPress 4.9 beta 3](https://wordpress.org/news/2017/10/wordpress-4-9-beta-3/), removed in [WordPress 4.9 beta 4](https://wordpress.org/news/2017/10/wordpress-4-9-beta-4/), and is expected to land in WordPress core when 4.9.1 is released in late 2017/early 2018.

To install this plugin, drop it into your site's `wp-content/mu-plugins` directory.
